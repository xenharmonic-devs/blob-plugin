Beautiful Lattice Overhead Brojector - Offline Plugin Version

Goals, as detailed by Joakim Bang Larsen
1. You load an image into the program.
2. You click a key on your keyboard and release it.
3. A transparent shape appears that you can choose the color and shape for. In this example weâ€™ll use a small yellow circle with 50% transparency. 
4. You place the shape over the corresponding note on the lattice image.
5. You repeat this with all the other keys on your keyboard.
6. Now you have a lattice you can play! Try fingering a chord and see the little yellow circles mark it off in the image.
