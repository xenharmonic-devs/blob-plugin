Beautiful Lattice Overhead Brojector - Offline Plugin Version

Latest Build - 2019-05-03 (contact for download)

This plugin allows you to put MIDI-triggerable light-up "blobs" onto an image.

The purpose is for a dead-easy way to get visualization a musical lattice.

* To add a "blob", control-click a location. 

* To resize a "blob", shift-drag a blob.

* Clicking on a blob selects it for assigning a MIDI note. Simply select a blob, trigger a MIDI note, and that blob will light up whenever that note is played.

* To recolor a blob, go to "Edit > Show Color Picker", then select a blob, and change the color. You can also change the transparency value.

* The last selected color will become the new default color for blobs.

* The light up effect is the inverse of the alpha value.

* Save and load your layouts!

BUGS:

* Clicking on a blob moves repositions it's center.
* Blobs can get lost offscreen.
* Probably more...
